# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository.

## What this is

A Hugo site using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, deployed to
GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. It publishes a technical research diary covering
security and CS work — arXiv, USENIX, IEEE S&P, NDSS, ACM CCS, DEF CON, Black Hat, [un]prompted,
and implementation docs.

Content is **written by Google Jules**, driven from the Jules web console (no API, no orchestration
in this repo). Jules reads `AGENTS.md`; that file is the pipeline specification. GitHub Actions only
validates the pull request Jules opens and deploys after merge.

## Read these first

Before changing site configuration, styling, or the deploy pipeline, read:

1. **`REFERENCE_caa20260903_153422.md`** — the configuration reference. Documents every PaperMod
   param (site-wide, per-page, and both), the CSS-variable colour/layout system, what **cannot**
   be configured without overriding theme templates, and which settings are dead no-ops. Written
   by inspecting the theme source, so it is more current than the PaperMod wiki.
2. **`README.md`** — setup, local development, and deploy.

`REFERENCE_*.md` files are timestamped; if several exist, read the newest.

## Hard rules

### Do not hardcode `baseURL`

CI builds with `hugo --minify --baseURL "<configure-pages base_url>/"`, which overrides
`config.toml`. The `actions/configure-pages` step resolves the real deployed URL at build time —
GitHub's equivalent of GitLab's `$CI_PAGES_URL`. This is deliberate: it survives the
`/research_diary` project subpath, repo or account renames, and a custom domain added later.

- Leave `baseURL = "/"` in `config.toml`. It affects local builds only.
- Do not set `relativeURLs = true`. Hugo's docs restrict it to filesystem-navigable sites; it
  leaves RSS `<link>` and `og:url` non-absolute, breaking feeds and link previews.
- Do not remove the `--baseURL` flag from the build job in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

See §4 of the reference for the full rationale and the verified failure modes.

### Generated content is confined to an allowlist

The pipeline's entire input is untrusted — paper text, conference slides, arbitrary web pages — fed
to an agent with write access to this repo. A poisoned document that talks the agent into editing a
workflow would otherwise be merged automatically.

`automation/scripts/pathguard.py` therefore restricts generated changes to:

- `content/arxiv/*.md`
- `content/conferences/*.md`
- `content/deep-dives/*.md`
- `automation/state/*`

Content is Markdown-only on purpose: Hugo serves a `.html` file in `content/` verbatim, without
Goldmark, and `validate.py` only globs `*.md` — so any-extension patterns would hand the agent a raw
HTML publishing primitive that nothing inspects.

Anything else fails the check and blocks auto-merge. **Do not widen that allowlist**, and do not add
a path to it so that a failing run goes green. If a pipeline change genuinely needs to touch another
file, a human makes that change in a separate commit.

This has already gone wrong once. In `a79aa37` the agent hit the guard and added `.github/workflows/*`,
`config.toml` and `pathguard.py` to it; in `990b2d8` it moved those same paths out of the test's DENY
list into ALLOW so CI went green. The guard then permitted precisely what it existed to stop, for
three commits. `test_pathguard.py` now pins the whole `ALLOWED` tuple against a literal, so widening
it fails the suite rather than being ratified by an edited expectation list. Keep that pin.

#### The guard must run from `main`, never from the pull request

For a same-repo branch, `on: pull_request` runs the workflow file **and the scripts** from the PR
head. A pull request that edits `pathguard.py` is therefore checked by its own edited copy. That is
why `validate-content.yml` is explicitly *not* the trust boundary, and why the merge lives in
`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` under `on: workflow_run` — that trigger always runs the default
branch's copy. It re-runs `main`'s guard against the PR's diff via `--head`, and only then merges.

Two invariants to preserve there: `auto-merge.yml` must never check out or execute anything from the
pull request, and the path check must come before the content checkout.

The guard also inspects blob modes and both sides of a rename. Neither is cosmetic: `--name-only`
prints only the destination of a rename, so `git mv .github/workflows/pages.yml content/conferences/x.md`
used to read as a single allowed path while the workflow silently vanished.

### Grounding is checked in code, not asked for in prose

`AGENTS.md` has always said "every item must carry a source URL". `validate.py` implemented that as
one `re.search` over the whole body, so a 4,176-word deep dive with 33 references passed on the
strength of a single `http`. Ten of those references did not support what they were attached to:
five attached an invented talk title to a bare conference index URL taken verbatim from
`topics.toml`, one was the DOI in `automation/examples/research-example.md` with the year changed by
a digit, one was a real arXiv ID for an unrelated paper, and three were plain 404s.

The lesson is not "write a stricter spec". The agent followed the spec exactly. Anything about
content quality that is stated only in `AGENTS.md` is advisory; if it matters, it goes in
`validate.py` (offline, also run in the Jules VM) or `linkcheck.py` (network, gating in CI).

Both use `automation/scripts/postparse.py` for parsing, and the tests there are the important ones:
every case is a shape the published posts or the shipped examples actually use. The false-positive
traps, all of which were hit during development:

- Both format examples wrap Also-published bullets and reference entries across two lines. A
  per-line "every bullet needs a URL" rule fails five items in shipped content.
- Deep-dive prose sections legitimately contain no URL, so per-item source checks are brief-only.
- Reference entries appear as both `1.` and `[1]`; citations appear grouped (`[9, 10]`).
- `content/conferences/` prose contains `argv[1]`, and code fences contain `##` and URLs.

`linkcheck.py` gates on `doi.org` and `arxiv.org` only. Both answer honestly — an unregistered DOI
is a 404 and a registered one a 302, **checked without following the redirect**, which sidesteps the
publisher WAF behind it. Measured against the published posts, `dl.acm.org`, `blackhat.com` and
`cisa.gov` all 403 a datacenter IP and `usenix.org` times out intermittently, so those are reported
and never enforced. arXiv rate-limits hard; when its API will not answer, the check skips rather
than reporting every cited preprint as nonexistent.

The gating linkcheck run lives in its own `auto-merge.yml` job with `contents: read`. It is the one
step that acts on pull-request *data* (never code), fetching URLs that originated in untrusted pages,
so it must not share a runner with the merge job's write token.

### Keep the format examples real

`automation/examples/` is the agent's format prompt, and it used to teach the shape with invented
arXiv IDs and DOIs. A deep dive then produced `arXiv:2605.12345` — the same `26XX.XXXXX` shape — and
mutated the example's S&P DOI by one digit. Every identifier in those files is now real and
resolving, and each file says so. Do not put a plausible-looking fake identifier in an example.

### TOML tables swallow every key below them

This bit the repo twice. In `config.toml`, seven top-level settings — `buildFuture` among them — sat
below `[pagination]` and were silently scoped into it, so Hugo never applied them. The same mistake
put `tags` inside `[discovery]` in `automation/config/topics.toml`.

When adding a key to any `.toml` here, check it lands where you think:

```shell
python3 -c "import tomllib;print(sorted(tomllib.load(open('config.toml','rb'))))"
```

### Dates must be RFC3339 UTC

`buildFuture = false`, so Hugo **silently drops** a future-dated page — green build, no warning, post
never appears. A local `+08:00` offset is enough to trigger it near the cron time.
`automation/scripts/validate.py` rejects non-UTC and future dates, and CI additionally asserts each
changed page rendered to `public/`. Both checks exist because the failure is invisible otherwise.

### The theme floats to latest

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs `hugo mod get -u`, so the theme tracks PaperMod master and the `go.mod` pin
is ignored at build time. Verify theme behaviour against master, not against `go.mod`.

Practical trap: the dark-mode CSS selector is `:root[data-theme="dark"]` on master; it was `.dark`
until early 2025. Snippets written for `.dark` silently do nothing.

### `layouts/` holds three forked theme templates

`validate-content.yml` fails the build on any `^WARN` line, and Hugo 0.166 warns about three calls
deprecated in v0.158.0. One is ours (`languages.en.label` in `config.toml`). The other two are inside
the PaperMod module, which cannot be patched in place, so the repo overrides three theme files:

| File | The one line that differs |
|---|---|
| `layouts/baseof.html` | `.Language.LanguageDirection` → `.Language.Direction` (3x) |
| `layouts/rss.xml` | `site.Language.LanguageCode` → `site.Language.Locale` |
| `layouts/_partials/templates/opengraph.html` | `site.Language.LanguageCode` → `site.Language.Locale` |

Each carries a header comment naming the theme commit it was copied from (`d376885`). Since the
theme floats to master, **these will drift**: when re-syncing, copy the theme file again and re-apply
that single substitution rather than hand-editing the fork. Delete them once upstream PaperMod stops
using the deprecated calls.

Fixing only `baseof.html` and `rss.xml` leaves the build still warning — `opengraph.html` is easy to
miss. The theme's `header.html` and `translation_list.html` also call `.Language.LanguageName`, but
they sit behind a multi-language guard that never runs on this single-language site, so they warn
about nothing and are deliberately not overridden.

`layouts/rss.xml` starts with a trimmed comment (`*/ -}}`). Untrimmed, the newlines land ahead of
the XML declaration and every feed becomes malformed.

### `fulltext.py` is the only way the pipeline reads a PDF

Jules' `view_text_website` returns a page as plain text and cannot read a PDF, so every paper
published only as one has to go through `fulltext.py`. It was arXiv-only — `retrieve()` formatted its
argument into `arxiv.org/{html,pdf}/<id>` — while the conference backlog holds landing-page URLs and
no abstract. So a conference item had no route at all: every route failed, the fallback returned an
*empty* string dressed as `source="abstract"`, and `content/conferences/2026-09-15-daily-brief.md`
shipped eight NDSS papers whose entire body was the abstract-only marker. `validate.py` passed it,
because an item only has to carry a bullet and a URL.

It now takes an arXiv id or any http(s) URL. A body starting `%PDF` *is* the paper; anything else is
treated as a landing page and the paper PDF it links to is fetched instead — sniffed rather than
guessed from the extension, which also covers extensionless venue PDFs. Three things there are load-
bearing:

- **The link resolver is stdlib `html.parser`, not BeautifulSoup.** It decides which URL gets fetched
  out of an untrusted page, so it must run in the half of `test_fulltext.py` that is *not* skipped
  when bs4 is missing — which is CI. `html_to_text` hands bs4 `"html.parser"` anyway.
- **It picks the paper, never the slide deck.** NDSS links both as PDFs on the same host. A resolver
  taking the first `.pdf` would report `source="pdf"` for a brief written off someone's slides.
- **`source="none"` is not `source="abstract"`.** `abstract` means an abstract was supplied and is
  what you are holding; `none` means nothing came back and the item must not be written up at all.
  The empty-string-as-success return is the bug that produced the brief above.

`idstate.canonical` is used only to *detect* the arXiv case, never as the URL to fetch: it coerces
everything else into a URL, turning `file:///etc/passwd` into `https:///etc/passwd`.

### Dependencies stop at the merge path

`requirements.txt` (`beautifulsoup4`, `html2text`, `pypdf`) exists for `fulltext.py` only, installed
once in the Jules VM's environment snapshot. Everything that gates a merge — `pathguard.py`,
`validate.py`, `postparse.py`, `linkcheck.py` — stays stdlib-only, so no third-party package sits
between an untrusted pull request and a `contents: write` token. `validate-content.yml` runs no
`pip install`, and `test_fulltext.py` skips its library-backed half rather than failing there.
Keep that split when adding tooling.

### Revert `go.mod` / `go.sum` after local builds

`hugo mod get` rewrites both. Unless a dependency change is the actual goal:

```shell
git checkout -- go.mod go.sum
```

## Where things go

| Change | File |
|---|---|
| Site config, params, menus | `config.toml` |
| Colours, fonts, layout geometry | `assets/css/extended/custom.css` (concatenated after theme CSS) |
| arXiv briefs (daily, from the RSS feeds) | `content/arxiv/` |
| Conference briefs (venue pages and open-web search) | `content/conferences/` |
| Deep dives | `content/deep-dives/` |
| Other pages | `content/` |
| Static files served at site root | `static/` |
| Build and deploy | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` |
| Content pipeline spec (read by Jules) | `AGENTS.md` |
| Research scope, sources, tag vocabulary | `automation/config/topics.toml` |
| Pipeline tooling and its tests | `automation/scripts/` |
| Post parsing shared by the checkers | `automation/scripts/postparse.py` |
| arXiv RSS ingestion | `automation/scripts/arxiv.py` |
| Full-text retrieval (needs `requirements.txt`) | `automation/scripts/fulltext.py` |
| Conference backlog queue | `automation/scripts/queue.py` |
| Backlog state | `automation/state/backlog.ndjson` |
| Citation resolution (network) | `automation/scripts/linkcheck.py` |
| Deduplication state | `automation/state/seen.ndjson` |
| Content format references | `automation/examples/` |
| PR validation (advisory; runs PR code) | `.github/workflows/validate-content.yml` |
| Auto-merge — the trust boundary, runs from `main` | `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` |

Do not add files to `themes/` — the theme is a Hugo module. The directory holds only `.gitkeep`.

## Verifying changes

Run the script suite first — it needs no dependencies and catches most breakage in a second:

```shell
for t in automation/scripts/test_*.py; do python3 "$t" || break; done
python3 automation/scripts/validate.py
```

`linkcheck.py` needs network and is slow (it rate-limits itself per host), so run it only on what
you changed:

```shell
python3 automation/scripts/linkcheck.py --files content/deep-dives/<post>.md
```

Hugo is not installed locally; use a Docker image. CI pins its own Hugo version (`HUGO_VERSION` in
the workflow), so this approximates CI rather than matching it exactly. Full commands are in §7 of
the reference. Minimum bar before reporting a config or template change as done:

Do **not** use `hugomods/hugo:exts` for this. It floats, currently ships Hugo v0.154.5, and that
predates `.Language.Direction` — so it cannot render the `layouts/` forks and fails on every page
with `can't evaluate field Direction in type *langs.Language`. Pull the pinned `.deb` instead, which
also exercises the same checksum CI verifies:

```shell
docker run --rm -e PAGES_URL="https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/research_diary" \
  -e HUGO_VERSION=0.166.0 \
  -e HUGO_SHA256=52b06555f739b1a08e04f5c31296e9bdf166a012e9b7e3137befc889dbc24db8 \
  -v "$PWD":/src -w /src golang:1.23-bookworm sh -c '
    set -e
    apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq curl git
    curl -sSL -o /tmp/hugo.deb \
      "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb"
    echo "${HUGO_SHA256}  /tmp/hugo.deb" | sha256sum -c -
    dpkg -i /tmp/hugo.deb
    git config --global --add safe.directory /src
    hugo mod get -u github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod
    hugo --minify --baseURL "$PAGES_URL/" -d /tmp/ci'
git checkout -- go.mod go.sum
```

Expect no `WARN` or `ERROR` lines. For styling changes, also check the rendered output rather than
assuming a param took effect — several plausible-looking PaperMod params are no-ops (reference §4).

## Conventions

- Renaming the site means updating `title` and `[params.homeInfoParams] Title` in `config.toml`,
  and the `module` line in `go.mod`.
- `LICENSE` is MIT, Copyright (c) 2014 Spencer Lyon, inherited from the upstream GitLab Pages
  Hugo example. Do not silently rewrite or delete it.
- `AGENTS.md` is Jules' entry point; `CLAUDE.md` is Claude's. Keep the hard constraints in the two
  files consistent — if the allowlist changes in one, it must change in the other and in
  `pathguard.py`.
- Content frontmatter is **TOML** (`+++`), not YAML, so `validate.py` can parse it with stdlib
  `tomllib` instead of a hand-rolled YAML parser. The permitted key set is pinned in
  `validate.py`'s `ALLOWED_KEYS`; PaperMod renders several other params (`cover.image`,
  `canonicalURL`, `editPost.URL`) straight into HTML attributes, so adding one is a human decision.
- `goldmark.renderer.unsafe = false` and `enableInlineShortcodes = false` in `config.toml` are
  security settings, not style. Posts quote untrusted abstracts near-verbatim; `unsafe` would publish
  any markup in that material, and an inline shortcode is arbitrary Go-template execution in the
  build runner. `validate.py`'s `check_markup` rejects the same things independently.
- Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs and the Hugo `.deb` is checksum-verified (`HUGO_SHA256`).
  Bump `HUGO_VERSION` and `HUGO_SHA256` together, taking the hash from the release's own
  `hugo_${HUGO_VERSION}_checksums.txt`.
