"""Reject generated changes that touch anything outside the content allowlist.

The pipeline's entire input is untrusted: paper text, conference slides and web
pages, fed to an agent that has write access to this repository and can execute
code. A poisoned document that talks the agent into editing a workflow file would
otherwise be merged automatically.

So the trust boundary is here, not in the prompt. Whatever the agent was told or
talked into, a pull request may only change:

    content/arxiv/**           the arXiv briefs
    content/conferences/**     the conference briefs
    content/deep-dives/**      the deep dives
    automation/state/**        dedup and backlog bookkeeping

Anything else — workflows, config.toml, go.mod, the scripts themselves, this file
— fails the check, blocks auto-merge, and leaves the pull request open for a
human to look at.

Usage:
    pathguard.py --base origin/main          # diff against a branch
    pathguard.py --files a.md b.md           # check an explicit list
    git diff --name-only origin/main | pathguard.py --stdin
