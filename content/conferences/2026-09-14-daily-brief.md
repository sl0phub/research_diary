## In brief

- Four of the seven items are fuzzing work, and all four move the target rather than the technique:
  the Bluetooth host stack instead of the controller, RISC-V data paths instead of control flow,
  proprietary proximity protocols instead of file formats.
- Two independent items land on privileged background services reached without user interaction —
  the recurring theme of the batch.
- Most of these are accepted-paper listings without published full text, so the entries below are
  necessarily thin on results; they are pointers, not summaries of findings.

## Exploiting Android Apps with Counterfeit Art

- Arbitrary file overwrite is a common Android bug class whose impact has until now depended on
  which file a particular app happened to expose, making it hard to rate consistently.
- The technique targets the runtime-generated app image rather than an app-specific file, which is
  what makes the escalation to code execution app-agnostic and persistent.
- Generality is the claim; the listing does not say how many shipping apps are reachable this way.

## Protocol Prying: Systematic Vulnerability Research in the AirDrop and Android Quick Share Proximity Transfer Protocols

- First cross-platform reverse engineering and protocol-aware fuzzing of both proximity transfer
  stacks, which are proprietary and undocumented despite a reported five billion devices running
  one or the other.
- The surface is zero-click by construction: both are reachable from wireless proximity with no
  prior pairing, and both parse layered serialized formats — binary plists, CPIO archives, protocol
  buffers, UKEY2 handshakes — inside privileged daemons.
- Coverage is bounded by how completely the stacks were reverse-engineered, so quiet regions are not
  evidence of their absence of bugs.

## FuzzBT: Holistic-State-Guided Fuzzing for Bluetooth Host Stack in Kernels

- Bluetooth fuzzing work to date has concentrated on emulating devices and driving the controller;
  the host stack, which lives in the kernel, has been left largely untested.
- That matters because the host stack is where the protocol state actually accumulates — it issues
  controller commands, exposes the API to userspace, establishes logical links and multiplexes
  channels — so a fuzzer that ignores that state cannot reach most of it.
- The approach is to guide fuzzing by whole-stack state rather than per-message validity; the
  listing gives no bug counts or coverage figures.

## SoK: PHILTER: Uncovering Security and Functional Gaps in AI-based Phishing Website Detection Literature via an LLM-based Reasoning Framework

- A systematisation of the AI phishing-detection literature, using an LLM-based reasoning framework
  to audit published methods rather than to detect phishing.
- The question it puts to the field is whether high reported accuracy survives four requirements
  that deployment imposes and papers rarely test: resilience to evolving tactics, robustness on
  diverse benign pages, interpretability, and privacy.
- It evaluates the literature, not deployed systems, so it bounds what the published record
  supports rather than measuring what production detectors do.

## DRVFuzz: Data-Sensitive RISC-V CPU Fuzzing

- Hardware fuzzers for CPU cores are mostly data-agnostic: they mutate instruction sequences and
  score on control-path coverage, which leaves bugs that only manifest for particular operand values
  out of reach.
- DRVFuzz makes the data sensitive part of the search, aimed at the RISC-V logic bugs that produce
  faulty privilege transitions and architectural state corruption.
- No comparison against existing hardware fuzzers is given in the listing.

## You Have Been LaTeXpOsEd: A Large-Scale Systematic Analysis of Information Leakage in Preprint Archives Using Large Language Models

- First large-scale security audit of arXiv itself: 1.2 TB across 100,000 submissions, looking for
  sensitive information authors did not mean to publish.
- The leak channel is everything shipped alongside the PDF — auxiliary code, images, and LaTeX
  source including embedded comments — which authors generally do not think of as published.
- Of direct relevance to this diary, since arXiv source is a compulsory input here.

## Enjoy the Free Lunch, Someone Paid for Us: Escaping Resource Limits of MicroVM-based Containers

- MicroVM-based containers are deployed across AWS, Azure and Alibaba Cloud to get container
  density with VM-grade isolation; the resource limits that make that economics work are the target
  here.
- The escape is of the resource accounting rather than the isolation boundary — a tenant obtaining
  more CPU, memory or I/O than was provisioned, at the expense of co-tenants and the provider.
