*This file is a format reference, not published content. It lives outside `content/` on purpose.*

*Every identifier below is real and resolves. That is deliberate: the previous version of this file
used invented IDs to illustrate the shape, and a deep dive copied one, changed a digit, and
published it. Do not treat any identifier here as a template to adapt — see hard constraint 9 in
AGENTS.md.*

## In brief

- Both items target privileged code reached without user interaction: one through a file the runtime
  regenerates, one through daemons that parse untrusted input from anyone in wireless range.
- The pattern to watch is proximity and background services being treated as trusted input paths.

## Exploiting Android Apps with Counterfeit Art

- Arbitrary file overwrite is a common Android bug class whose impact has until now depended on
  which file a given app happened to expose, making it hard to rate.
- The technique targets the runtime-generated app image instead of an app-specific file, which makes
  the escalation to code execution work across apps rather than one at a time, and persist.
- Generality is the contribution here; the write-up does not quantify how many shipping apps are
  reachable this way.

## Protocol Prying: Systematic Vulnerability Research in the AirDrop and Android Quick Share Proximity Transfer Protocols

- First cross-platform reverse engineering and protocol-aware fuzzing of both proximity transfer
  stacks, which are proprietary and undocumented despite running on a reported five billion devices.
- The exposure is that both are reachable from wireless proximity with no prior pairing, and both
  parse layered serialized formats — binary plists, CPIO archives, protocol buffers, UKEY2
  handshakes — inside privileged daemons, which is a zero-click surface by construction.
- Fuzzing a reverse-engineered protocol bounds coverage by how completely the stack was recovered,
  so absence of findings in a region is not evidence about it.
