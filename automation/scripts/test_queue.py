"""Offline checks for queue.py.

The cases are the ones that actually cost something when wrong: a batch larger
than the configured ceiling, an item that comes back after being written up, the
same paper queued twice under two URL spellings, a state file whose ordering is
unstable enough to conflict on every concurrent pull request, and an item left
pending after its batch handed it out -- which, because the order is stable,
occupies the same slot on every run from then on.
